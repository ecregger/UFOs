# UFOs Analysis

## Purpose
This page is posted so that the public may have access to UFO sighting data in order to form their own opinion on alien existence. 

## How to filter the results
<p>Once the page loads you will see the introduction and below that, a data table: https://github.com/ecregger/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/UFO_1.png. </p>
<p>You can then use the filter to the left to drill-down into the dataset and analyse the data that is of interest to you. https://github.com/ecregger/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/UFO_2.png </p>

## Drawbacks
A drawback to this page is the fact that while the table filtering works well. There isn't enough detailed data. There also should be navigation to other articles or stories of encounters, etc.

## Suggested Improvements
- Articles and stories of encounters. 
- More data and links to each record in the set where you can see a more expansive description of the sightings.
